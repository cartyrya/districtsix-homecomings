          <h2>Project Description</h2>
          <p class="lead">This digital project will rebuild the virtual tour aspects of the District Six Museum in Cape Town. Utilizing recently collected map data, we will reconstruct District Six as it was in the 1960s, in respect to its multicultural community, prior to its designation as a “white area” and period of forced removal. Then, using the oral histories the Homecoming Centre has collected, we will impose the oral histories onto the map. Site visitors will be able to interact with the map, selecting which aspects they’d like to engage with, such as oral histories, music, images, and more.</p>
          <p class="lead">This is meant to serve as an extension of the Homecoming Centre, to provide a virtual homecoming and digital memorialization, for those who are unable to visit the site in person.</p>
          <h2>Audience</h2>
          <img class="rounded-circle img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="media/audiencephoto1.jpg" alt="">
          <p class="lead">The District Six Museum prioritizes conversation of displacement in its design, as more than 60,000 people were forcibly removed and experienced land dispossession in the community. In respect to memorializing trauma as well as joy and possibilities, we hope to center the experiences and desires of those for whom it is home. The physical and digital space is also one of public learning, pushing us to make this project accessible for multiple audiences.</p>
          <h2>Deliverables/Outcomes</h2>
          <p class="lead">The project will generate the following deliverables/outcomes:</p>
          <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>Website based virtual map tour</li>
            <li>2D georectified map of District Six</li>
            <li>Pins indicating location of oral histories</li>
            <li>Oral history video/audio/stills</li>
            <li>Pins indicating landmarks, video/stills</li>
